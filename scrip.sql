During this visit, healthcare providers perform a thorough physical examination, which includes measuring the baby\'s weight, length, and head circumference to monitor growth patterns. They also assess vital signs, examine the baby\'s eyes, heart, hips, and, in boys, testicles, to identify any abnormalities. Screening tests are conducted to detect rare but serious conditions; for instance, a small blood sample is taken from the baby\'s heel to test for various disorders. Additionally, a hearing test and oxygen level assessment are performed to ensure the baby\'s auditory and respiratory health. This checkup provides an opportunity for parents to discuss any concerns, receive advice on feeding, sleeping, and general newborn care, and establish a schedule for future well-baby visits to monitor the baby\'s ongoing health and development.','\nBrief Info:\nNewborn Health Checkup is a comprehensive medical examination conducted within the first few days after birth to assess a newborn\'s overall health, growth, and development. This initial checkup is crucial for early detection of any potential health issues and to provide parents with guidance on newborn care.',7,70.00,0.00,'assets/images/services/service19.jpg',1,'2025-01-31 23:46:55','2025-02-16 11:38:46'),(20,'Growth Monitoring','The Growth Monitoring service entails periodic evaluations of a child\'s physical development, typically conducted monthly during the early years. Healthcare providers measure and record key growth indicators, plotting them on standardized growth charts to track progress over time. This process helps identify any deviations from expected growth patterns, which may signal underlying health or nutritional issues. When such concerns are detected, tailored counseling and interventions are provided to address the specific needs of the child. Regular growth monitoring not only ensures that children are developing appropriately but also serves as a platform for caregivers to receive guidance on nutrition, feeding practices, and overall child care. By closely observing growth trends, healthcare providers can implement preventive measures and promote healthy development, thereby reducing the risk of malnutrition and associated health complications.','Growth Monitoring is a routine health service that involves the regular measurement and assessment of a child\'s growth parameters, such as weight, height, and head circumference, to ensure proper development. This practice is essential for early detection of growth faltering or malnutrition, allowing for timely interventions to promote optimal health outcomes.',9,60.00,0.00,'assets/images/services/service20.jpg',1,'2025-01-31 23:46:55','2025-02-16 11:38:46'),(21,'Chickenpox Vaccination','The Chickenpox Vaccination service provides immunization to safeguard children from chickenpox, a highly contagious disease characterized by an itchy rash and fever. The vaccination schedule includes two doses: the first dose is recommended between 12 and 15 months of age, and the second dose between 4 and 6 years old. For children older than 6 who have not been vaccinated or had chickenpox, two doses are administered at least three months apart. The vaccine is highly effective, with two doses providing approximately 98% protection in children. Vaccinated individuals who contract chickenpox typically experience milder symptoms. Common side effects are mild and may include soreness or swelling at the injection site. This vaccination is essential for preventing chickenpox and its potential complications, ensuring children\'s health and well-being.','Chickenpox Vaccination is a preventive immunization service that protects children against varicella-zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox. The vaccine is administered in two doses to ensure effective immunity.',3,50.00,0.00,'assets/images/services/service21.jpg',1,'2025-01-31 23:46:55','2025-02-16 11:38:46'),(22,'Pneumococcal Vaccination','The Pneumococcal Vaccination service involves administering a series of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) to children, following a recommended immunization schedule. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that all children younger than 5 years old receive a 4-dose PCV series, with one dose at each of the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 through 15 months. The vaccines used, such as PCV15 or PCV20, are effective in preventing pneumococcal diseases and are administered by qualified healthcare professionals. Adhering to the vaccination schedule is crucial for ensuring optimal protection during the early years of a child\'s life. Parents are encouraged to consult with their pediatrician to keep their child\'s immunizations up to date and to discuss any concerns regarding the vaccine.\n\nBy completing the pneumococcal vaccination series, children gain significant protection against potentially life-threatening infections, contributing to their overall health and well-being.','Pneumococcal Vaccination is a preventive immunization service designed to protect children against infections caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, commonly known as pneumococcus.
